My name is Hope Trimmer, and I'm a sophomore at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/) studying journalism. I made this account for my Data Journalsim class.

## Lehigh Admissions Infographic
I created this infographic for my data journalism class using Canva. The data reflects admissions statistics of the class of 2027 and was derived from [Lehigh Univrsity Data Center](https://www1.lehigh.edu/admissions/admission-statistics).
